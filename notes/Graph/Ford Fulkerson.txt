Back edges are necessary when doing the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm in case the path that you choose ends up not being a part of the overall flow.
As an example where back edges are necessary, consider this flow network:

    s
   / \
  a   b
   \ / \
    c   d
     \ /
      t
Assume that all edges point down and that all edges have capacity 1 and that you want to find a flow from s to t. Suppose on the first iteration of Ford-Fulkerson that you take the path s -> b -> c -> t. At this point, you've pushed one unit of flow from s to t. If you don't add in any back edges, you're left with this:

    s
   / 
  a   b
   \   \
    c   d
       /
      t
There are no more s-t paths, but that doesn't mean you have a max flow. You can push two units of flow from s to t by sending one along the path s -> a -> c -> t and the other along the path s -> b -> d -> t. Without any back edges in the residual flow network, you would never discover this other path.
